# Extra Features!

### View Driver Report

In addition to being able to download the .csv report, the dispatcher has the opportunity to view the report before downloading.

### Handle Conflicting Tasks Gracefully

The program gracefully handles conflicting tasks by not only providing the option to delete the conflicitng task but the program will suggest an alternative date/time for the task to be rescheduled. If time permitted, I would have added extra functionality such that the dispatcher would be able to select the suggested time.

### Aesthetically Pleasing UI

Used animations to create a delightful user interface. good use of color and shadows to make a clean easy to use app. I color coded the type of tasks so upon glancing at the calendar the dispatcher could quickly understand the information.  

### User Experience

The app was created as a single page application (SPA) to make it quick and responsive.

### Deploy The App

The app has been deployed and can be viewed at [taskapp.kalistabaig.me](http://taskapp.kalistabaig.me)
